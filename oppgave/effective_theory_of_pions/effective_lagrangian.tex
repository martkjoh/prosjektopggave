\section{QCD}

In this paper we consider an effective theory of quantum chromo dynamics, QCD, at low temperature and with two quarks, up and down.
These quarks have a mass matrix 
\begin{equation}
    \label{Mass matrix}
    M =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        m_u & 0 \\
        0 & m_d
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
In the isospin limit, $m_u = m_d$, the theory is invariant under global transformations by elements of the group $G' = \lieg{SU}{2}_L \times \lieg{SU}{2}_R \times \lieg{U}{1}_V$.
All terms involving only pions are trivially invariant under $\lieg{U}{1}_V$, (HVORFOR?) so we focus on the $G = \lieg{SU}{2}_L \times \lieg{SU}{2}_R$ subgroup.
This symmetry is spontaneously broken if the quark field has a non-zero ground state expectation value $\ex{\bar q q}$, leaving only a subgroup $H = \lieg{SU}{2}_V \subseteq G$ of symmetry transformations of the vacuum state.
The Goldstone manifold $G/H = \lieg{SU}{2}_A$ is a three-dimensional Lie group, and therefore results in three (pseudo) Goldstone bosons, the pions.
There exists an isomorphism from a subset $S \subseteq M_1$ of the set of all Goldstone-fields
\begin{equation*}
    M_1 = \curly{ \pi_a: \Em_4 \longrightarrow \R^3 | \pi_a \, \mathrm{smooth} }
\end{equation*}
close to the ground state, into fields taking values in the Goldstone manifold $G/H$. (BEVISE?)(HVA ER ISOMORFISME HER?).
The \chpt effective Lagrangian will be constructed using this map, through the parametrization
\begin{align}
\label{sigma}
    \Sigma : \Em_4 & \longrightarrow \lieg{SU}{2},\\ \notag
    x & \longrightarrow \Sigma(x) = A_\alpha (U(x) \Sigma_0 U(x)) A_\alpha,
\end{align}
where
\begin{align*}
    \Sigma_0 = \one,\, 
    A_\alpha = \exp(\frac{i \alpha}{2} \tau_1),\, 
    U(x) = \exp(i \frac{\tau_a\pi_a(x)}{2f}).
\end{align*}
$\tau_a$ are the $\SU(2)$ generators, i.e. Pauli matrices, as described in \autoref{Conventions and notation}.
$\pi_a$, where $ \, a \in \curly{1, 2, 3}$, are the pion fields. These are real fields, meaning $\pi_a^\dagger = \pi_a$.
