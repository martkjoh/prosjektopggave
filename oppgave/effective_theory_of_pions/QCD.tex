\section{QCD}

In this paper we consider an effective theory of quantum chromo dynamics, QCD, at low temperature and with two quarks, up and down.
These quarks has a mass matrix 
\begin{equation}
    \label{Mass matrix}
    M =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        m_u & 0 \\
        0 & m_d
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
In the isospin limit, $m_u = m_d$, the theory is invariant under global transformations by elements of the group $G' = \lieg{SU}{2}_L \times \lieg{SU}{2}_R \times \lieg{U}{1}_V$.
All terms involving only pions are trivially invariant under $\lieg{U}{1}_V$, (HVORFOR?) so we focus on the $G = \lieg{SU}{2}_L \times \lieg{SU}{2}_R$ subgroup.
