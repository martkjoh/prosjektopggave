  abstract = {In a recent paper, Chisholm has proved the important theorem that the S-matrix in quantum field theories remains unchanged under any point transformation of field operators. In view of some unsatisfactory features in his argument, another proof of this theorem, within the framework of the conventional canonical formalism of field theories, is given. Further, it is pointed out that on the basis of Chisholm's theorem, most of the ordinary equivalence theorems in field theories can be obtained by rather trivial changes of variables in the Lagrangians. The equivalence theorem for the Yang-Mills field is discussed in detail.}
