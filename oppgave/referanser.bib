  abstract = {In a recent paper, Chisholm has proved the important theorem that the S-matrix in quantum field theories remains unchanged under any point transformation of field operators. In view of some unsatisfactory features in his argument, another proof of this theorem, within the framework of the conventional canonical formalism of field theories, is given. Further, it is pointed out that on the basis of Chisholm's theorem, most of the ordinary equivalence theorems in field theories can be obtained by rather trivial changes of variables in the Lagrangians. The equivalence theorem for the Yang-Mills field is discussed in detail.}

abstract = {JaxoDraw is a Feynman graph plotting tool written in Java. It has a complete graphical user interface that allows all actions to be carried out via mouse click-and-drag operations in a WYSIWYG fashion. Graphs may be exported to postscript/EPS format and can be saved in XML files to be used for later sessions. One of JaxoDraw's main features is the possibility to create  code that may be used to generate graphics output, thus combining the powers of  with those of a modern day drawing program. With JaxoDraw it becomes possible to draw even complicated Feynman diagrams with just a few mouse clicks, without the knowledge of any programming language.
Program summary
Title of program: JaxoDraw Catalogue identifier: ADUA Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/ADUA Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University of Belfast, N. Ireland Distribution format: tar gzip file Operating system: Any Java-enabled platform, tested on Linux, Windows ME, XP, Mac OS X Programming language used: Java License: GPL Nature of problem: Existing methods for drawing Feynman diagrams usually require some ‘hard-coding’ in one or the other programming or scripting language. It is not very convenient and often time consuming, to generate relatively simple diagrams. Method of solution: A program is provided that allows for the interactive drawing of Feynman diagrams with a graphical user interface. The program is easy to learn and use, produces high quality output in several formats and runs on any operating system where a Java Runtime Environment is available. Number of bytes in distributed program, including test data: 2117863 Number of lines in distributed program, including test data: 60000 Restrictions: Certain operations (like internal latex compilation, Postscript preview) require the execution of external commands that might not work on untested operating systems. Typical running time: As an interactive program, the running time depends on the complexity of the diagram to be drawn.}

abstract = {The Green's functions of QCD are expanded in powers of the external momenta and of the quark masses. The Ward identities of chiral symmetry determine the expansion up to and including terms of order p4 (at fixed ratio mquarkp2) in terms of a few constants, which may be identified with the coupling constants of a unique effective low energy Lagrangian. The low energy representation of several Green's functions and form factors and of the ππ scattering amplitude are then calculated. The values of the low energy coupling constants are extracted from available experimental data. The corrections of order Mπ2 to the ππ scattering lengths and effective ranges turn out to be substantial and the improved low energy theorems agree very well with the measured phase shifts. The observed differences between the data and the uncorrected soft pion theorems may even be used to measure the scalar radius of the pion, which plays a central role in the low energy expansion.}
