\chapter{Computer code}
\label{appendix:computer code}

All computer code used in this specialization project is available in an online repository, located at \url{https://github.com/martkjoh/prosjektoppgave}.
The code for symbolic calculation is in the folder \url{https://github.com/martkjoh/prosjektoppgave/tree/main/scripts}. These are Jupyter-notebooks, run with a SageMath kernel.
SageMath is an open-source Python-based computer algebra system (case), which is available for download at this webpage: \url{https://www.sagemath.org}.
The code for numerical calculation and to generate plots, as well as the generated numerical results, are available at \url{https://github.com/martkjoh/prosjektoppgave/tree/main/scripts}.
The code is written in Python and uses the scientific libraries NumPy, SymPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
