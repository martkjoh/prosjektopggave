\subsection{Free energy of the pions}
The partition function of \chpt is 
\begin{equation}
    Z = \int \D \pi_a \, \exp{i \int \dd x \Ell[\pi_a]}
    = 
    \int \D \pi_a \, \exp{i \int \dd x \left(\Ell_2 + \Ell_4 + ... \right)}.
\end{equation}
Considering only the lowest order Lagrangian, it may be written expanded around $\pi_a = 0$
\begin{equation}
    \Ell_2[\pi_a] 
    = \Ell_2[\pi_a = 0] 
    + \pi_a  \pdv{\Ell_2}{\pi_a}\Big|_{\pi_a=0}
    + \pi_a \pi_b \pdv[2]{\Ell_2}{\pi_a}{\pi_b}\Big|_{\pi_a=0}
    + \Oh[3]{(\pi/f)}.
\end{equation}
We showed that, when minimizing $\alpha$, $\pdv{\Ell_2}{\pi_a}\Big|_{\pi_a=0} = 0$. 
Furthermore, $\Ell_2[\pi_a = 0] = \Ell_2^{(0)}$ so the partition function may be written
\begin{equation}
    Z = \int \D \varphi_a \, 
    \exp{i \int \, \left( \Ell_a^{(0)} +  \right)}
\end{equation}


The lowest order contribution to the pion is given by the free propagator, \autoref{free pion propagator}, by the formula \autoref{free energy from propagator}.
This is, however, evaluated in the imaginary-time formalism.
In the zero-temperature limit, 
This means that the time coordinate is replaced by $t \rightarrow - \tau$, and is restricted to $\tau \in [0, \beta]$.
This result in a discrete set of energies, the Matsubara frequencies $\omega = 2 \pi n / \beta$.
The result is
\begin{equation}
    \beta \Ef = \frac{1}{2V} \Tr{\ln[\beta^2 D_0^{-1}]} 
    = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\tilde \Omega} \dd K \, \sum_a \ln[\beta^2 D_0^{-1}]_{aa}
\end{equation}
At $T = 0$, this is given by (HVORFOR?)
\begin{equation}
    \Ef = \frac{1}{2} \int \frac{\dd^4 k}{(2 \pi)^4} \sum_a \ln[D_0^{-1}]
    = \frac{1}{2} \int \frac{\dd^4 k}{(2 \pi)^4} 
    \left[\ln(p_0^2 - E_+^2) +  \ln(p_0^2 - E_-^2) + \ln(p_0^2 - E_0^2) \right]
\end{equation}
