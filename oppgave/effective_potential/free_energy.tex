\subsection{Free energy of the pions}
The lowest order contribution to the pion is given by the free propagator, \autoref{free pion propagator}, by the formula \autoref{free energy from propagator}.
This is, however, evaluated in the imaginary-time formalism.
This means that the time coordinate is replaced by $t \rightarrow - \tau$, and is restricted to $\tau \in [0, \beta]$.
This result in a discrete set of energies, the Matsubara frequencies $\omega = 2 \pi n / \beta$.
The result is
\begin{equation}
    \beta \Ef = \frac{1}{2V} \Tr{\ln[\beta^2 D_0]} 
    = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\tilde \Omega} \dd K \, \sum_a \ln[\beta^2 D_0]
\end{equation}
