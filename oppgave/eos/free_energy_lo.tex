\section{Free energy at lowest order}
\label{section: free energy at lowest order}

The equation of state (EOS) relates the thermodynamic variables of as system.
In this section, we will obtain the equation of state of the pions by calculating their free energy.
We use the effective Lagrangian found in \autoref{serction:effective_pion_lagrangian} to find the leading-order contribution to one loop, and the next-to-leading order contribution at the tree-level, following the procedure used in~\cite{mojahed, Andersen:two-flavor-chpt}.\footnote{Leading order and next-to-leading order, in this context, refers to Weinberg's power counting scheme.}
The free energy density of a homogenous system is
\begin{equation}
    \Ef = - \frac{1}{V \beta} \ln Z.
\end{equation}
Here, $Z$ is the partition function, and $V$ the volume of space.
Using imaginary time formalism for thermal field theory, which is described in \autoref{section:thermal field theory}, we find that the partition function is given by the path integral of the \emph{Euclidean} Lagrange density, as shown in equation \cref{free scalar result 2}.
In the zero temperature limit $\beta \rightarrow \infty$, the partition function is related to vacuum transition amplitude $Z_0 = Z[J=0]$, as described in \autoref{section:path integral}, by a Wick rotation.
The free energy density at zero temperature is therefore 
\begin{equation}
    \Ef = \frac{i}{VT} \ln Z_0,
\end{equation}
where $VT$ is the volume of space-time.
This equals the effective potential in the ground state, which we found an explicit formula for in \autoref{section: effective action}, \cref{effective potential}.
We write $\Ef = \Ef^{(0)} + \Ef^{(1)} + \dots$, where $\Ef^{(n)}$ refers to the $n$-loop contributions to the free energy density.

\subsection*{Tree-level contribution}
The tree-level contribution $\Ef^{(0)}$ is the classical potential, which is given by the static ($\pi$-independent) part of the Lagrangian.
From \cref{L0} we have the leading order contribution,
\begin{equation}
    \Ef_2^{(0)}
    = - \Ell_2^{(0)} 
    = 
    -f^2   
    \left(
        \bar m^2 \cos{\alpha}
        + \frac{1}{2} \mu^2 \sin^2{\alpha}
    \right),
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ parameterizes the ground state, which means that its value must minimize the free energy.
\begin{align*}
    &\diffp{}{\alpha} \Ef_2^{(0)} 
    = f^2\left(\bar m^2 - \mu_I^2\cos{\alpha}\right)\sin{\alpha}
    = 0.
\end{align*}
This equation defines the relationship between the chemical potential $\mu_I$, and the ground state parameter $\alpha$, as illustrated in \autoref{fig:free energy surface}.
This gives the criterion
\begin{align}
    \label{leading order minization}
    \alpha \in \{0, \pi\} \quad
    \mathrm{or} \quad
    \cos{\alpha} = \frac{\bar m^2}{\mu_I{}^2}.
\end{align}
As we see in the figure, $\alpha = \pi$ is a maximum, and thus unstable.
This means that for all values $\mu_I^2 \leq \bar m^2$, we will have $\alpha = 0$, and the system will remain in its ground state.

In our discussion of the effective potential we also found that the ground state should minimize the classical potential, as shown by \cref{minimize classical potential}.
This means that the linear part of the classical potential should vanish.
The linear part of the classical potential is given by \autoref{L1} to leading order, and reads $\Ve^{(1)} = f(\mu_I{}^2\cos{\alpha} - \bar m^2)\sin{\alpha} \, \pi_1 $, which vanishes given \cref{leading order minization}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figurer/numerics/free_energy_surface.pdf}
    \caption{The surface gives free energy as a function of $\mu_I$ and $\alpha$. $\alpha$ is the found by minimizing $\Ef$ for a given $\mu_I$. This leads to a curve across the free energy surface, as show in the plot.}
    \label{fig:free energy surface}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{One-loop contribution}
The one loop contribution to the free energy density is
\begin{equation}
    \label{one loop free energy}
    \Ef^{(1)}
    = - \frac{i}{V T} \frac{1}{2}
    \Tr{\ln\left( -\fdiff{S[\pi = 0]}{\pi_a(x), \pi_b(y)} \right)}.
\end{equation}
This can be evaluated using the rules for functional differentiation given in \autoref{section:Functional derivative}.
To leading order, 
\begin{align}
    \fdiff{S[\pi = 0]}{\pi_a(x), \pi_b(y)}
    = \fdiff{}{\pi_a(x), \pi_b(y)}
    \int \dd^4 x \, \Ell^{(2)}_2
    = D^{-1}_x \delta(x - y).
\end{align}
Here, $\Ell^{(2)}_2$ is the quadratic part of the Lagrangian, as given in \autoref{quadratic lagrangian}, and $D^{-1}_x$ is the corresponding inverse propagator of the pion fields,
\begin{equation}
    D_x^{-1} = 
    - \left[
        \delta_{ab}(\partial_x^\mu\partial_{x,\mu} + m^2_a)
        -  m_{12}(\delta_{a1} \delta_{b2} - \delta_{a2}\delta_{b1}) \partial_{x, 0}
    \right] 
\end{equation}
The inverse propagator is a matrix, which means that the determinant in \autoref{one loop free energy} i both a matrix determinant, over the three pion indices, as well as a functional determinant.
In \autoref{section:propagator} we found the matrix part of the determinant in momentum space, which we can write using the dispersion relations of the pion fields
\begin{equation}
    \det(- D^{-1}) = \det(-p_0^2 + E_0^2) \det(-p_0^2 + E_+^2) \det(-p_0^2 + E_-^2).
\end{equation}
These dispersion relations are functions of the three-momentum $\vec p$, and are given in \cref{dispresion relation pi 0,dispresion relation pi pm}.
The functional determinant can therefore be evaluated as
\begin{align}
    \nonumber
    \Tr{\ln\left( -\fdiff{S[\pi = 0]}{\pi_a(x), \pi_b(y)} \right)}
    & = \ln \det(-p_0^2 + E_0^2) + \ln \det(-p_0^2 + E_+^2) + \ln \det(-p_0^2 + E_-^2) \\
    \nonumber
    & = \Tr{ \ln(-p_0^2 + E_0^2) + \ln(-p_0^2 + E_+^2)+  \ln(-p_0^2 + E_-^2) } \\
    & = (VT) \int \frac{\dd^4 p}{(2 \pi)^4} 
    \left[ \ln(-p_0^2 + E_0^2) + \ln(-p_0^2 + E_+^2) + \ln(-p_0^2 + E_-^2)  \right],
\end{align}
where we have used the identity $\ln\det M = \Tr \ln M $.
These terms all have the form
\begin{equation}
    I = \int \frac{\dd^4 p}{(2 \pi)^2} \ln(-p_0^2 + E^2),
\end{equation}
where $E$ is some function of the 3-momentum $\vec p$, but not $p_0$.
We use the trick
\begin{equation}
    \pdv{\alpha} \left(-p_0^2 + E^2\right)^{-\alpha} \Big|_{\alpha=0}
    = \pdv{\alpha} \exp\left[ -\alpha \ln\left(- p_0^2 + E^2\right)  \right] \Big|_{\alpha=0}
    = \ln\left(- p_0^2 + E^2\right),
\end{equation}
and then perform a Wick-rotation of the $p_0$-integral to write the integral on the form 
\begin{equation}
    I = i \pdv{\alpha} \int \frac{\dd^4 p}{(2 \pi)^4} \left(p_0^2 + E^2\right)^{-\alpha} \Big|_{\alpha=0},
\end{equation}
where $p$ now is a Euclidean four-vector.
The $p_0$ integral equals $\Phi_1(E, 1, \alpha)$, as defined in \autoref{def dimreg integral}. 
The result is therefore given by \autoref{result dimreg},
\begin{equation}
    \int \frac{\dd p_0}{2 \pi} (p_0^2 + E)^{-\alpha} 
    = \frac{E^{1-2\alpha}}{\sqrt{4 \pi}} \frac{\Gamma(\alpha-\frac{1}{2})}{\Gamma(\alpha)}.
\end{equation}
The derivative of the Gamma function is $\Gamma'(\alpha) = \psi(\alpha)\Gamma(\alpha)$, where $\psi(\alpha)$ is the digamma function.
Using
\begin{align}
    \diffp{}{\alpha} & \frac{\Gamma(\alpha - \frac{1}{2}) }{\Gamma(\alpha)} \Big|_{\alpha=0}
    = \Gamma\left(\alpha - \frac{1}{2}\right) \frac{\psi(\alpha - \frac{1}{2}) - \psi(\alpha)}{\Gamma(\alpha)} \Big|_{\alpha=0}
    = \sqrt{4 \pi}, \\
    & \frac{\Gamma(\alpha - \frac{1}{2}) }{\Gamma(\alpha)}\Big|_{\alpha=0} = 0,
\end{align}
we get
\begin{equation}
    I = i \int \frac{\dd^3 p}{(2 \pi)^3} E.
\end{equation}
We see that the result is what we would expect physically, the total energy is the integral of the energy of each mode.
This also agrees with the result from \autoref{section:thermal field theory} in low temperature limit $\beta \rightarrow \infty$.
This results in 
\begin{equation}
    \Ef^{(1)} = 
    \frac{1}{2} 
    \left[\int \frac{\dd^3 p}{(2\pi)^3} E_0 + \int  \frac{\dd^3 p}{(2\pi)^3} (E_+ + E_-)\right]
    = \Ef^{(1)}_{\pi_0} +\Ef^{(1)}_{\pi_\pm}.
\end{equation}
The first integral is identical to what we find for a free field in \autoref{section:free scalar field}, in the zero temperature limit $\beta \rightarrow \infty$.
These terms are all divergent, and must be regularized. 
We will use dimensional regularization, in which the integral is generalized to $d$ dimensions, and the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$-scheme, as described in \autoref{section: regualting free energy}.
Using the result for a free field \cref{free field regularized energy}, we get
\begin{equation}
    \Ef^{(1)}_{\pi_0} 
    = 
    - \frac{1}{4} \frac{m_3^4}{(4\pi)^2} 
    \left[ \frac{1}{\epsilon} + \frac{3}{2} + \ln(\frac{\mu^2}{m_3^2}) \right] + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon),
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ is the renormalization scale, which is introduced ensure that the integral has the same engineering dimension for $d \neq 3$.

The contribution to the free energy from the $\pi_+$ and $\pi_-$ particles is more complicated, as the dispersion relation is given by
\begin{equation}
    E_\pm
    = 
    \sqrt{
        |\vv p|^2 +
        \frac{1}{2}
        \left(
            m_1^2 + m_2^2 + m_{12}^2 
        \right)
        \pm 
        \frac{1}{2}
        \sqrt{
            4|\vv p|^2m_{12}^2 
            +
            \left(
                m_1^2 + m_2^2 + m_{12}^2
            \right)^2
            - 4 m_1^2 m_2^2
        }
    }.
\end{equation}
This is not an integral we can easily do in dimensional regularization.
Instead, we will seek a function $f(|\vv p|)$ with the same UV-behavior, that is behavior for large $\vv p$, as $E_+ + E_-$.
If we then add $0 = f(|\vv p|) - f(|\vv p|)$ to the integrand, we can isolate the divergent behavior
\begin{equation}
    \Ef_{\pi_\pm}^{(1)}
    = 
    \frac{1}{2} \int \frac{\dd^3 p}{(2\pi)^3} [E_+ + E_- + f(|\vv p|) - f(|\vv p|)]
    = \Ef^{(1)}_{\mathrm{fin}, \pi_\pm } + \Ef^{(1)}_{\mathrm{div}, \pi_\pm}.
\end{equation}
This results in a finite integral, 
\begin{equation}
    \Ef^{(1)}_{\mathrm{fin}, \pi_\pm } = \frac{1}{2} \int \frac{\dd^3 p}{(2\pi)^3} [E_+ + E_- - f(|\vv p|)],
\end{equation}
which we can evaluate numerically, and isolate the divergence to
\begin{equation}
    \Ef^{(1)}_{\mathrm{div}, \pi_\pm }
    = 
    \frac{1}{2} \int \frac{\dd^3 p}{(2\pi)^3} f(|\vv p|),
\end{equation}
which we hopefully will be able to do in dimensional regularization.
We can explore the UV-behavior of $E_+ + E_-$ by expanding it in powers of $1 / \abs{\vv{p}}$,
\begin{align}
    \nonumber
    E_+ + E_-
    & = 
    2  \abs{\vv{p}}
    + \frac{m_{12} + 2(m_1^2 + m_2^2)}{4} \, {\abs{\vv{p}}}^{-1}
    - \frac{m_{12}^4 + 4 m_{12}^2(m_1^2 + m_2^2) + 8(m_1^4 + m_2^4)}{64}
    {\abs{\vv{p}}}^{-3}
    + \Oh[-5]{ \abs{\vv{p}}} 
    \\
    & = 
    a_1  \abs{\vv{p}}
    + a_2 \, {\abs{\vv{p}}}^{-1}
    + a_3
    {\abs{\vv{p}}}^{-3}
    + \Oh[-5]{ \abs{\vv{p}}}.
\end{align}
We have defined the new constants $a_i$ for brevity of notation.
As
\begin{equation}
    \int_{\R^3} \frac{\dd^3 p}{(2 \pi)^3} |\vv p|^{n}
    = C \int_{0}^\infty \dd p \, p^{2 + n}
\end{equation}
is UV divergent for $n \geq -3$, $f$ need to match the expansion of $E_+ + E_-$ up to and including $\Oh[-3]{|\vv{p}|}$ for $\Ef^{(1)}_{\mathrm{fin}, \pi_\pm }$ to be finite.
The most obvious choice for $f$ is
\begin{equation}
    f(|\vv p|) 
    = a_1  \abs{\vv{p}} + a_2 \, {\abs{\vv{p}}}^{-1} + a_3 \, {\abs{\vv{p}}}^{-3}.
\end{equation}
However, this introduces a new problem.
$f$ has the same UV-behavior as $E_+ + E_-$, but the last term diverges in the IR, that is for low $|\vv p|$.
This can be amended by introducing a mass term.
Let
\begin{equation}
    |\vv p|^{-3} 
    = 
    \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{|\vv p|^2}}\right)^3 
    \longrightarrow 
    \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{|\vv p|^2 + m^2}}\right)^3.
\end{equation}
For $|\vv p|^2 \rightarrow \infty$, this term is asymptotic to $|\vv p|^{-3}$, so it retains its UV behavior.
However, for $|\vv p| \rightarrow 0$, it now approaches $m^{-3}$, so the IR-divergence is gone.
The cost of this technique is that we have introduced an arbitrary mass parameter.
Any final result must thus be independent of the value of $m$ to be acceptable.

We will instead regularize the integral by defining $E_i = \sqrt{|\vv{p}|^2 + \tilde m_i^2}$, and $\tilde m_i^2 = m_i^2 + \frac{1}{4} m_{12}^2$.
Using the definition of the mass parameters, \cref{m1,m2,m3,m12}, we get
\begin{align}
    m_3^2 & = \bar m^2 \cos \alpha + \mu_ I^2 \sin^2 \alpha, \\
    \label{tilde m1}
    \tilde m_1^2 
    & 
    = m_1^2 + \mu^2 \cos\alpha^2
    = \bar m^2 \cos \alpha + \mu_I^2 \sin^2 \alpha
    = m_3^2 \\
    \label{tilde m2}
    \tilde m_2^2 
    & = m_2^2 + \mu^2 \cos\alpha^2
    = \bar m^2 \cos \alpha.
\end{align}
Finally, we define $f(|\vv p|) = E_1 + E_2$ which differ from $E_+ + E_-$ by $\Oh[-5]{|\vv p|}$, and is well-behaved in the IR.
This leads to a divergent integral the same form as in the case of a free scalar.
Thus, in the $\mathrm{\overline{MS}}$-scheme, 
\begin{equation}
    \Ef^{(1)}_{\mathrm{div}, \pi_\pm }
    =
    - \frac{1}{4} \frac{\tilde m_1^4}{(4\pi)^2} 
    \left[
        \frac{1}{\epsilon} + \frac{3}{2} + \ln(\frac{\mu^2}{\tilde m_1^2}) 
    \right] 
    - \frac{1}{4} \frac{\tilde m_2^4}{(4\pi)^2} 
    \left[
        \frac{1}{\epsilon} + \frac{3}{2} + \ln(\frac{\mu^2}{\tilde m_2^2})
    \right] 
    + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon).
\end{equation}
We define
\begin{equation}
    \Ef^{(1)}_{\mathrm{fin}, \pi_\pm}
    = 
    \frac{1}{2} \int \frac{\dd^3 p}{(2\pi)^3} (E_+ + E_- - E_1 - E_2),
\end{equation}
which is a finite integral.
The total one-loop contribution is then, using \cref{tilde m1,tilde m2},
\begin{align}
    \Ef^{(2)}
    & = 
    \Ef^{(1)}_{\mathrm{fin}, \pi_\pm} 
    - \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{(4\pi)^2}
    \left[
        \left( \frac{1}{\epsilon} + \frac{3}{2} + \ln \frac{\mu^2}{m_3^2 } \right)
        m_3^4
        +
        \frac{1}{2}
        \left( \frac{1}{\epsilon} + \frac{3}{2} + \ln \frac{\mu^2}{\tilde m_2^2} \right)
        \tilde m_2^4
    \right]
\end{align}
