The standard model describes, together with Einstein's general theory of relativity, all experiments we as humans are able to perform.
It uses the language of quantum field theory to describe (X) particles, and their interactions.
Quantum electrodynamics, or QED, is the description of electromagnetic interactions.
It gives some of the most accurate predictions in science (EKSEMPEL).
This is calculated using the techniques of Feynman diagrams, which describes how quantum fields interact as the sum of all possible ways patterns of interaction.
When the interaction is weak, as is the case for QED, we get a sum that converges quickly, and can get highly accurate estimates by calculating a few orders of the sum.

Quantum chromodynamics, or QCD is the part of the standard model that describes quarks, the constituents of protons and neutrons, and how they interact via the strong nuclear force.
As the name suggests, the strong force is not weak, at least not for low energies, and thus do not allow for an approach using Feynman diagrams.
Instead, one can use the approach of \emph{effective field theory}.
